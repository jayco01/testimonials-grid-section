- How to **effectively use CSS Grid** for a structured layout.
- How to implement **background images** and control their positioning.
- Improved my understanding of **box-shadow** for better visual depth.

- The importance of **semantic HTML** for readability and accessibility.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Enhance **accessibility features** (e.g., ARIA labels, improved contrast).
- Add **subtle hover effects** to improve user interaction.
- Optimize CSS for better **performance and maintainability**.
